# What's a Prompt?

| Concept | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prompt | The natural language input to a generative AI model where the user tells the model what to do. It can be a question, instruction, input data, or examples. The prompt guides the model's response and influences the generated output. | "Write a 3-paragraph long love letter." |
| Image Generation Prompt | A description of the image the user wants to generate using image generation AI models. The prompt provides specific details such as visual attributes, style, and other relevant parameters to guide the image generation process. | "A fat crocodile with a gold crown on his head, wearing a three-piece suit, 4K, professional photography, studio lighting, LinkedIn profile picture, photorealistic." |
| Text-to-Image Model Prompt | The text input that describes the image to be generated using text-to-image AI models.

| CVS File Prompt | The input to a generative AI model that includes raw data in a CSV file format. The model can utilize this additional data for generating more contextually relevant outputs. | Using a CSV file with raw data as part of the prompt input. |
| Large Language Model Prompt | The input to large language models like GPT-4 and ChatGPT. The prompt can vary from simple questions to complex problems with inserted data. It can also be vague statements or high-level tasks for generative task-oriented models. | "Who is the president of the US?" or "Tell me a joke, I'm feeling down today." or "I need to organize a one-week trip to Greece." |
| Prompt Design | The process of structuring and formulating a prompt to maximize the desired outcome from the generative AI model. Understanding the model's limitations and utilizing effective prompt elements can lead to better results and minimize issues like hallucination. | Designing a prompt with instructions, questions, input data, and examples to guide the model's response and generate valuable knowledge. |
