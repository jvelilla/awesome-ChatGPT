# Generative AI

| Concept | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prompt engineering | Involves designing and crafting effective prompts to interact with AI models. It is important for users to understand how to communicate with AI and follow good prompt engineering practices. | Medical doctors involved in prompt engineering to design an interface with AI in healthcare. |
| Generative AI | Refers to a new class of AI models and applications that can generate content based on a natural language prompt input. It goes beyond traditional AI models by not only identifying and classifying inputs but also generating new content. | Large language models like GPT-4 and ChatGPT, which can generate realistic conversations and reason about facts based on natural language input. |
| Large language models | AI models trained on a vast amount of text from the internet, books, and other sources. They are trained to predict the next token or word. These models exhibit emergent behavior and can engage in realistic conversations and reason about facts under certain constraints. | GPT-4, ChatGPT, LLaMA, Sparrow, Bard, LaMDA |
| Text to Image | AI models trained to translate text into images. | DALL-E 2 |
| Action transformers | AI models capable of translating text into actions, such as clicking on a link or browsing the internet. | Models capable of translating text into actions like clicking on a link. |
| Transformer architecture | A neural network architecture introduced in the "Attention Is All You Need" paper by Google researchers. Transformers utilize the attention mechanism and have become the foundation for many generative AI models. | Transformers, such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT, are based on the transformer architecture. |
| Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) | A training approach where AI models learn from human feedback using reinforcement learning. It has become a crucial aspect in the latest training stages. | AI models using RLHF to improve their performance by learning from human feedback. |
| Diffusion models | Novel models used for image and multimedia processing, which have become essential for generating high-quality content. | Stable Diffusion, Midjourney |
| Zero-shot learning capability | The ability of AI models to learn and understand new information without the need for retraining. They can adapt to novel tasks or concepts that were not part of their initial training. | General models that can learn from new information without retraining. |
